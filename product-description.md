# Genomic Epidemiology of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) | Nextstrain 

The source code outlining how this product gathers, transforms, revises and publishes its datasets is available at [https://github.com/rearc-data/nextstrain-hcov-19](https://github.com/rearc-data/nextstrain-hcov-19).

## Main Overview
Nextstrain is an open-source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data. They provide a continually-updated view of publicly available data with powerful analytics and visualizations showing pathogen evolution and epidemic spread. Their goal is to aid epidemiological understanding and improve outbreak response.

This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of hCoV-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) viruses from the ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. This phylogeny shows an initial emergence in Wuhan, China, in Nov-Dec 2019 followed by sustained human-to-human transmission leading to sampled infections. Although the genetic relationships among sampled viruses are quite clear, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of specific transmission dates and in reconstruction of geographic spread. Please be aware that specific inferred transmission patterns are only a hypothesis.

#### Data Source
This resource contains JSON tree data files (global, North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Afria) offering genetic analysis of the geographic spread of hCoV-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) viruses.
